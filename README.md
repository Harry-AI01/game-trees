# Othello Game with Alpha-Beta Pruning AI

This project implements a simple version of the classic Othello game (also known as Reversi) in Python. It features an AI opponent that utilizes the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm for intelligent decision-making. Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization of the Minimax algorithm, aimed at reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree to improve efficiency without compromising the quality of decisions.

## Features

- Play against an AI that strategically determines its moves using Alpha-Beta pruning.
- Simple command-line interface for easy interaction and gameplay.
- Implements basic Othello game rules and logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
